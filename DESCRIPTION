Description: Provides a Shiny application to construct age-specific life tables and fertility
 schedules from individual female daily egg records. The application computes
 age-specific survival, fertility and reproduction functions and estimates key
 demographic parameters including the net reproductive rate, mean generation time,
 intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase and doubling time. Optional
 confidence intervals for demographic parameters can be obtained using percentile
 bootstrap or delete-1 jackknife resampling at the female level.
